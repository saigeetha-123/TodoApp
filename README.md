# TodoApp
 The code implements a Todo List application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, allowing users to add, complete, and delete tasks dynamically. Tasks are saved in localStorage for persistence and displayed interactively with checkboxes and delete icons. The design is styled with Bootstrap and custom CSS for a modern, user-friendly interface.
